# StimTrialProject
A class-based framework for conducting visual stimulation experiments

This aim of the projet is to test ideas and develop a MATLAB class-based system for conducting visual stimulation experiments using a unified framework (we hope) across a variety of display devices (RGBdisplay, OneLight, LEDarray, etc).
